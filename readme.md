## TODO:

- Create function that returns paragraphs
- Create function that wraps paragraphs with '<p></p>'
- Create function that returns sentences
- Create function that tokenize sentences

### Create highlight function

It will take two parameters, content, tag and class. It will use a regex to match the word wanted and replace it with the same word wrapper on the tag and the class wanted.
